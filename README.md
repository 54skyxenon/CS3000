# CS3000: Algorithms and Data

Hosts Python scripts I've written for pseudocode snippets during my Summer II algorithms class at Northeastern. Pull requests, bug fixes, and contributing new test cases are always welcome!

You may need to `pip install numpy` first to run all the scripts, since some algorithms need it.

### Topics by week:
* Week 1: Introduction, Stable Matching, Divide and Conquer
* Week 2: Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming
* Week 3: Dynamic Programming cont., Midterm I Review
* Week 4: Graph Theory
