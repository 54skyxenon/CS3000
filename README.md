# CS3000: Algorithms and Data

Hosts Python scripts I've written for pseudocode snippets during my Summer II algorithms class at Northeastern. Pull requests, bug fixes, and contributing new test cases are always welcome!

You may need to `pip install numpy` first to run all the scripts, since some algorithms need it. Also, make sure you run with a Python 3 interpreter, not Python 2.
